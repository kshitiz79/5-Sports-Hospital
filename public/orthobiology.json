      "description": "Orthobiologics and regenerative therapies harness the body’s natural ability to heal itself—without the need for invasive surgery. By using biologically active substances like platelet-rich plasma (PRP), bone marrow concentrate, and stem cells, these advanced treatments accelerate tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and promote long-term recovery. Ideal for athletes and active individuals, they offer faster healing, less downtime, and a powerful, science-backed alternative to traditional orthopedic procedures.",
